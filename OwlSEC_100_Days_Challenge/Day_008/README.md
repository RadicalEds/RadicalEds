**Day** 008 / **Date** (2025-11-08)    
**What I Worked On**:     
Did HTB beginner Challenge 'Responder'    
(Actually learned a thing or two today, namely the responder tool (really cool), as well as WinRM)    
    
Created a Script in Nodejs that Automates Dorking Search Engines with Puppeteer    
    
Script is a CLI tool that enumerates hosts through image searches (image searches return more results with less queries)    
    
found hosts and links are sorted into Tabbed CSV format or as a JSON array of Objects    
    
**What I Completed**: The Things I Worked On    
**Progress Vs Yesterday**: Another Day For 100 Days    
**Evidence**: See Attached Files    
**Next Steps**: Need to Add More Features.
