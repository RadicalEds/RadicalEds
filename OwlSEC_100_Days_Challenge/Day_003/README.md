**Day** 003 / **Date** (2025-11-03)    

**What I Worked On**    
1. Did HTB beginner Challenge 'Dancing'.    

2. Was inspired by <@970774891508957194>  to create a GitHub so I made a new Email Address, and a GitHub Account, Setup GPG and SSH Keys, logged in with gh cli, and configured local git    

3. Created My First Repository with a Script I wrote called ClipTrigger.    
It Triggers Modular Actions based on X11 Clipboard Content. Users May create custom "Triggers" for any automated purpose. I created and included one for Youtube Links.    

4. Packaged ClipTrigger for Debian as a buildable deb package.
