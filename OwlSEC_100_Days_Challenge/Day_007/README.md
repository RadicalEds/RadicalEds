**Day** 007 / **Date** (2025-11-07)    
**What I Worked On**:     
Did HTB beginner Challenge 'Crocodile'    
    
Wrote a Python Script that calculates perceptual hashes for Image files    
    
Currently, only the aHash algorithm is used.    
In future versions, we could specify other popular algorithms such as pHash or dHash, and we can even include some of our own custom algorithms.    
    
going to add a feature to calculate hamming distances between hashes as well.    
    
**What I Completed**: The Things I Worked On    
**Progress Vs Yesterday**: Another Day For 100 Days    
**Evidence**: See Attached Files    
**Next Steps**: Need to Add More Features.
