✅ `Version 1 of WPress`
> The Script Now Successfully Installs/Configures a LAMP Server with a TLS enabled Wordpress VHost from scratch
> 
> In less than a minute we go from a fresh domain to a fully functioning wordpress lamp installation.
> 
> - Now works as advertised.
> - Security features still need to be implemented.
> - The Next Verion will be able to modify an existing installation by adding plugins/themes and import/export users, posts, pages, and products
> 
> i had fun making this one and figuring things out, because i tried something i dont usually do, which I call spinners and blocks ([+])
> the spinner runs like a statusline while the code is being run, when the code is done running it reports as either success/failure
> 
> it then reports a status update in the form of a colored block with a message, based on the success/failure, and if the failure is too critical it starts the exit process.
> 
> reminds me a little of using async/await try/catch
