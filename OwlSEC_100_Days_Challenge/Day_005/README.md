**Day** 005 / **Date** (2025-11-05)    
**What I Worked On**:     
Did HTB beginner Challenge 'Appointment'    
    
Created a Script that Stores/Extracts Image files into a Sharable Video Archive.    
    
it has an option to obfuscate the images by scrambling their pixels, based on a numerical seed.    
People may share scrambled video archives and only people with the seed can retrieve the unscrambled images.    
    
the heavy lifting is done with ffmpeg and imagemagick.    
    
**What I Completed**: The Things I worked on

**Next Steps**: Im Unsure, The World Is My Oyster.
