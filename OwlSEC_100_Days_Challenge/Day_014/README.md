**Day** 014 / **Date** (2025-11-14)    
**What I Worked On**:     
    
Today On HTB I did:

HTB OSINT Challenge: "The Puppet Master"    
It Was Extremely Easy, Basic Image Lookup Via Google Images    

HTB OSINT Challenge: "Social Media Investigation Hub"    
Even Easier than the Last, looks at the social profiles and answers questions about them.    

HTB OSINT Challenge: "The Suspicious Domain"    
Very Easy, WhoIs Domain Info Q&A, Hardest Part Was Realizing The Topbar Slided to Reveal More Data Sources (lol My Bad)    

HTB OSINT Challenge: "The Suspicious Reviewer"    
This One Was The Easiest of them All, Im actually a bit dissapointed. Litteraly just find the email in the contact info and done, nothing more.    
(Took Longer to read the objective than to carry it out.)    

All Available "Very Easy" OSINT Challanges Completed.

Created A Personal Github Repository With Some of my Experiences for a README on my profile.    
Also, I Have Converted My 100 Days Thread Posts Into READMEs inside a Sub-Repository to Keep Track of Progress and Provide Proof of Work    

Hoping to Improve Upon My Writing Skills In The Coming Days.    
Will be Looking for Emojis and Whatnot to Add to my Posts to make them pop more.    



**What I Completed**: Some HTB Challenges and a Personal GitHub Repo    
**Progress Vs Yesterday**: Another Day For 100 Days    
**Evidence**: See Attached Files    
**Next Steps**:
