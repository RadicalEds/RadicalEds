**What I Worked On**:     
    
Today I did the HTB beginner Challenge: "Unified"    
learned about the ldap protocol, some java, log4j, and the unifi network server software    
    
This Challenge is the final free one available in the "Starting Point" series.    
I shall be moving on to building points from doing random free challenges from now on.    
    
I have also been working on my daemon boilerplate as well as a project im using it in.    
    
I've Added:    
- view engine/public docroot    
- api endpoints to manage the database    
- cmdline features to interact with the database/daemon/websocket    
    
I've Began Adding:    
- websocket functionality with drop in command plugins    
    
**What I Completed**: HTB Starting Point (All Free Challenges), HTB Unified    
**Progress Vs Yesterday**: Another Day For 100 Days
