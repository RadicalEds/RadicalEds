**Day** 016 / **Date** (2025-11-16)        
**What I Worked On**:         
        
Today On HTB I did:    
    
"Flag Command"    
I was Intrigued by this text based adventure, as it reminded me of playing the classic game: Zork.    
The Challenge Wasnt very hard at all, you just need to inspect the web requests with the devtools    
    
"Spookifier"    
Another Well Designed Challenge from XClow3n, this one is about server side template injection    
I learned about Python Flask and Mako Templates Engine    
    
"BabyEncryption"    
The Task Was to Decrypt an Encrypted Message.    
Looking at the Equation used to Encrypt it I wasnt sure if it would be possible to simply reverse the Equation because the Modulous Operator.    
In the End, I applied the equation to every possible character and compared its result to the encrypted message characters until i had the full decrypted message.    
    
"SpookyPass"    
A Simple Binary Where the Password is stored hardcoded in plaintext, solved within a few seconds    
    
    
**What I Completed**: Some HTB Challenges        
**Progress Vs Yesterday**: Another Day For 100 Days        
**Evidence**: See Attached Files        
**Next Steps**:
