✅ **`Evaluative`**    
> Needed help with this one as the term Polynomial was completely new to me.    
> In the end we evaluated the equation by multiplying each coefficient by x to the power of each iteration starting from 1, each iteration is summed to produce the number ( a mouth full i know, its easier to show it in code )    
> in python it looks like: `result += coefficients[i] * (x ** i)` where i is the index of the list we are iterating through    
    
✅ **`Low Logic`**    
> I knew nothing about the provided diagram, so Research was Required    
> After Learning about "Logic Gates", things started to make sense when I Started to view the inputs as "On/Off, True/False"    
> The Diagram Applied Two AND logic operators to the inputs and one OR logic operator to the output of the ANDs    
> 1 = true and 0 = false, so for example "1 & 0 = 0" and "1 | 0 = 1"    
> writing this into code and applying the equation to the list of values produced a binary string    
> converting this binary into ASCII produced the Flag    
    
✅ **`Primed For Action`**    
> First i needed to learn how to calculate prime numbers    
> Then I needed to identify the two primes in a list of numbers and then multiply them together to unlock the flag
