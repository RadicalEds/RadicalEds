**Day** 006 / **Date** (2025-11-06)    
**What I Worked On**:     
Did HTB beginner Challenge 'Sequel'    
    
Created a Script to detect data appended to known filetypes, atm it only supports png and jpeg files    
    
Inspired by Koske Miner, AI Generated Malware - https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-koske-linux-malware-hides-in-cute-panda-images/    
    
Upon Inspection, Malware Is simply appended to the end of Image Files    
    
This Script Detects Those Images.    
    
**What I Completed**: The Things I Worked On    
**Progress Vs Yesterday**: Another Day For 100 Days    
**Evidence**: See Attached Files    
**Next Steps**: Need to Add More Features and Filetypes.
